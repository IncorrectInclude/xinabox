# First introduction to programming on the xinabox

## What's in here?

### Ways to read each sensor available for the weather kit

Our group has the xinabox weather kit, and I'm learning
to program for them, so this arduino project, has a 
way to read some details off of those sensors. 

### Task Scheduler
This allows for someone to say, at compile time, 
that a method should be called so many milliseconds,
seconds, or hours, and then, as long as the scheduler
is updated periodically, it will ensure those methods
get called.
